As described by rh:

*Select/upload any picture. The pixels in the picture are analysed to work out the colour. Use pictures posted to twitter, instagram etc to fill each pixel. So each picture is scanned to determine the dominant colour and this is matched against a pixel in the image. Essentially the mosaic will remain active and get filled in piece by piece as pictures are found and the colours match. Specific twitter hashtags can be used to provide the source of images used.*
